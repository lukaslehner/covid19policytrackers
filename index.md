# A tracker of trackers: COVID-19 policy responses and data <!-- omit in toc -->

The amount of COVID-19 related research being produced within the first
weeks following the implementation of far-reaching lockdowns across the
globe has been impressive. To keep track of new sources, I have compiled a collection of currently over 100 policy trackers and datasets on the topic. The compilation is not meant to be
exhaustive and I am grateful for general feedback you may have or suggestions on new
sources. I am updating the tracker of trackers on a daily basis. Please email me at <lukas.lehner@spi.ox.ac.uk> or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukasLehner_) for updates.

Sections 15. and 16. on surveys are edited by [Elias Naumann](http://www.eliasnaumann.de/). For suggestions, please email him at <naumann@uni-mannheim.de>.

This collection started initially as a [Twitter
Thread](https://twitter.com/LukasLehner_/status/1243557931888578565) in

## 16. National and comparative surveys (with non-probability samples)
*edited by [@eliasnau](https://twitter.com/eliasnau/)*

We rank order the list of surveys by sampling method used. Surveys with non-probability samples either use quota sampling from commercial opt-in panels or snowballing via social media. We list surveys with quota sampling first,  since we believe that they provide somewhat higher data quality compared to snowball sampling. Within each category we rank order surveys according the number of countries covered.
